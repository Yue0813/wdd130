        <h2>Yue</h2>
        <p>My name is Yue. I came from China and I have been in America for seven years and half. I studied my master degree of Education in Ohio for my first two years and then moved to New York to work in a Chinese wholesale company. I want to do some online business by myself in the future, so I want to learn some courses about web design like WDD130.</p>
        <p>I love study and I love learning English. Although I have studied English for more than fifteen years, my English is still not good enough and I felt very frustrated. However, I will never give up to improve my English, because it changed my life. I am not the member of the Church, but I know more about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints through the online study.</p>
        <p>I will continue my learning journey and work hard in this semester.</p>
